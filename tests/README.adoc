Ansible roles tests
===================

== Introduction

These tests allow us to test our Ansible roles.

== Prerequisites

These tests require a cluster already deployed with the following parameters:
* an rbd Ceph pool called "rbd".
* a libvirt volume pool called "ceph" and being linked to the pool "rbd".

It also requires an inventory describing the cluster, the same as the one used
to deploy the cluster.

Finally, the test data must have been generated with the
"tests/generate_test_data.sh". This script requires qemu-img but can be called
with cqfd:
....
cqfd run tests/generate_test_data.sh
....

== Using tests

These tests are playbooks that can be used with ansible-playbook. They must be
launched from the root directory of the project. For example:
....
ansible-playbook -i my_inventory tests/test_import_disk.yaml
....
