Custom playbooks directory
=========================

Put your custom Ansible playbooks files here.

Remember that the relative paths in Ansible depend on the position of the
playbook. So to include a role present in the "roles" subfolder of the
repository root folder you need to prefix the role name with "../roles" in the
playbook. For example:

[source,yaml]
....
---
- hosts: hypervisors
  vars:
     - disk_name: disk
     - action: create
     - size: 2
  roles:
     - ../roles/seapath_manage_disks
....
